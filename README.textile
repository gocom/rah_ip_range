h1. rah_ip_range

"Packagist":https://packagist.org/packages/rah/rah_ip_range | "Issues":https://github.com/gocom/rah_ip_range/issues

Rah_ip_range is a "Textpattern CMS":https://textpattern.com plugin for restricting visitors' access to certain parts of site content based on their IP addresses. The plugin introduces a little Textpattern tag that takes an IP address range and an executed action. The tag can either be used to hide parts of a page template or to invoke a customizable error page.

h2. Install

Using "Composer":https://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer require rah/rah_ip_range

h2. Basics

bc. <txp:rah_ip_range fromip="127.0.0.1" toip="127.0.0.1" method="deny">
        ...contained statements...
</txp:rah_ip_range>

The plugin introduces a new Textpattern tag, @<txp:rah_ip_range />@. The tag can be used to restrict visitor's access to certain parts of page template content or full pages based on their IP address. The tag takes an IP range, set by @fromip@ and @toip@ attributes. A visitor that is in the specified range will be either denied or allowed access to the content based on @method@ attribute's setting.

The tag can be used both as a container and as a self-closing single tag. When used as single tag, the tag invokes an error page when the visitor is within denied range. As a container, the tag hides the wrapped content, but doesn't invoke an error page. A container can also take a "else":https://docs.textpattern.com/tags/else statement, which is served as an alternative content to denied visitors.

h2. Attributes

*message*
Error message shown to blocked visitors.
Example: @message="Sorry, we can not do that."@ Default: @"Forbidden."@

*status*
HTTP error status code returned to blocked visitors. The option is ignored when the tag is used as a container.
Example: @status="404"@ Default: @"403"@

*fromip*
IP-range's starting IP (or partial IP). Default is unset.
Example: @fromip="127.0.0.1"@ Default: @""@

*toip*
IP-range's ending IP (or partial IP). Default is unset.
Example: @toip="127.0.0.100"@ Default: @""@

*method*
Sets what to do to the visitor when IP is within the range. Either @deny@ or @allow@. When set to @deny@, all visitors within the range are blocked, and others outside the range are allowed to see the content. Value @allow@ is opposite to the @deny@.
Example: @method="deny"@ Default: @"allow"@

h2. Examples

h3. Using as a self-closing single tag

bc. <txp:rah_ip_range fromip="127.0.0.1" toip="127.0.0.100" method="deny" message="Access denied." />

Visitors within the range of 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.100 are blocked will see an error page.

h3. Using as a container

bc. <txp:rah_ip_range fromip="127.0.0.1" toip="127.0.0.100">
    <a href="http://example.com">Important link</a>.
<txp:else />
    Link is hidden.
</txp:rah_ip_range>

Visitors within the range 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.100 will see an important link, while others won't. Instead they are treated with _"Link is hidden."_ message where the link would be.
