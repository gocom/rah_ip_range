h1. rah_ip_range

p. An elegant "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com plugin for blocking and allowing visitors' access based on IP addresses. The plugin comes with a single little TXP tag that takes an IP address range, and an executed action. The tag can either be used to hide parts of a page, or to invoke an error page.

h2. List of features

* Deny and allow visitors with IP ranges.
* Comes with a simple tag, @<txp:rah_ip_range />@. Include the tag anywhere on your "page templates":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Pages and "forms":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Forms you want the blocking to take place.
* Blocked visitors will see Textpattern's native, customizable error page. Error messages and returned error status is fully configurable.
* Alternatively the tag can be used as a container. The wrapped content is hidden from blocked visitors, instead of showing an error page.

h2. Attributes

p. The tag is @<txp:rah_ip_range />@ attributes for it follow. Use the tag on places (pages/forms/sections) which you want to restrict from specific visitors.

p. *message*
Error message shown to blocked visitors. The message can be displayed with the "error_message":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=error_message tag. If the rah_ip_range tag is used as a container, the message is shown to the blocked visitors, instead of the wrapped content.
Default: @message="Forbidden."@ Example: @"Sorry, can not do that."@

p. *status*
HTTP error status code returned to blocked visitors. The option is ignored when the tag is used as a container.
Default: @status="503"@ Example: @"200"@

p. *fromip*
IP-range's starting IP (or partial IP). Default is unset.
Default: @fromip=""@ Example: @"127.0.0.1"@

p. *toip*
IP-range's ending IP (or partial IP). Default is unset.
Default: @toip=""@ Example: @"127.0.0.100"@

p. *method*
Sets what to do to the visitor when IP is within the range. Either @deny@ or @allow@. When set to @deny@, all visitors within the range are blocked, and others outside the range are allowed to see the content. Value @allow@ is opposite to the @deny@.
Default: @method="allow"@ Example: @"deny"@

h2. Examples

h3. Using the self-closing single tag.

bc. <txp:rah_ip_range fromip="127.0.0.1" toip="127.0.0.100" method="deny" />

p. Visitors within the range of 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.100 are blocked will see an error page.

h3. Using the tags as a container.

bc. Important link:
<txp:rah_ip_range fromip="127.0.0.1" toip="127.0.0.100" method="allow" message="Link is hidden.">
	<a href="http://example.com">Click here</a>.
</txp:rah_ip_range>

p. Visitors within the range 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.100 will see an important link, while others won't. Instead they are treated with _"Link is hidden."_ message where the link should be.
